A Matric Calculator (Console Application in C#) that reads tab delimited matrices from a text file (squareMatrices.txt) and performs user specified operations on it. The results are written in a tab delimited format to result.txt. 
Currently, addition, subraction, multiplication, and transpose operations are supported. I'm currently working on adding RREF Conversion functionality.
